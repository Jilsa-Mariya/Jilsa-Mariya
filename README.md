#Hey! I'm **Jilsa Mariya**.👋
I’m just a curious developer who’s always excited to learn new things and build projects that make a real difference. I’ve been diving into web development and creating tools to help people grow in their careers and contribute to a better world 🌍✨
Right now, I’m working on **SkillTrak**, **MoodMentor**, and **Loopfy**—each project has its own unique mission, and I’m loving how each one challenges me to grow as a developer. 🚀💻

**🚀 What I’m Working With**

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (still getting the hang of it, but I love it! 🎨)
**Backend**: Python (Flask) and Node.js (learning as I go 🐍💡)
**Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL (databases are like puzzles, and I enjoy solving them 🧩)
**Tools**: Git, VSCode, Figma (I spend too much time making things look pretty 👨‍💻✨)

**🧑‍💻 What’s On My Plate Right Now**

**SkillTrak**: A platform to help people track their skills and find courses to level up for the job they want. I'm working on making it more personalized so it feels like it’s really helping people 🎯📈
**MoodMentor**: A project focused on improving mental well-being by offering tailored guidance, resources, and support to create a better balance in life 💆‍♂️💡

**🌱 What I’m Learning**

**Optimizing Database Queries**: I’ve been digging into ways to optimize MySQL queries. It’s surprisingly tricky when dealing with large datasets, and I’m learning how to use indexes and write more efficient queries 📊🚀
**User Experience Design**: I’m getting into the nitty-gritty of UX design to make sure my projects are as user-friendly as possible. This involves studying usability principles, conducting user testing, and tweaking UI elements for better flow 🖌️👥
**Debugging**: I’m learning how to debug more effectively, especially when things break in production. I’m getting better at using tools like the browser console, Postman, and debugging techniques in Python and JavaScript 🔍🐛

**🎮 When I’m Not Coding…**
**Exploring New Tech**: I’m always reading blogs, watching YouTube tutorials, or browsing Stack Overflow to pick up new tips and tricks. It’s not always coding, but it helps me stay on top of new tools and trends 📰💡
**Taking Breaks**: Let’s be honest, coding for long hours can get overwhelming. I make sure to take regular breaks—whether it’s grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or just watching a few episodes of a TV series to reset ☕🚶‍♂️🎬
**Music & Creativity**: I love listening to music while coding—it helps me stay focused and keeps the energy up 🎧🎶. Sometimes, I even mess around with music production or pick up a guitar to unwind 🎸🎶
